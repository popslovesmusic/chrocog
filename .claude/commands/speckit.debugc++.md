Debug this C++ code for memory issues:
1. Check for memory leaks (unmatched new/delete, malloc/free)
2. Identify potential buffer overflows and out-of-bounds access
3. Verify proper RAII patterns and smart pointer usage
4. Look for dangling pointers and use-after-free bugs
5. Suggest fixes with code examples
