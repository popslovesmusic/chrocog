# Soundlab + D-ASE Consciousness Engine v1.0 Release

**Release Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Tag:** `v1.0.0`

## Summary

Release 1.0 delivers the production-ready Soundlab + D-ASE Consciousness Engine featuring automated release orchestration, cross-platform distribution artifacts, and comprehensive operator guidance. This milestone closes Feature Specification Step 40 and graduates the platform from the 0.9 release candidate to full general availability.

### Highlights

- ✅ Automated GitHub Actions pipeline builds, signs, and publishes Python wheels, source distributions, Docker images, and frontend bundles (FR-001–FR-004).
- ✅ Version metadata aligned to semantic versioning with tag validation at v1.0.0 (FR-002).
- ✅ Auto-generated changelog and release notes captured in `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` (FR-005–FR-006).
- ✅ GitHub Release publishing attaches signed artifacts, checksums, and documentation pointers (FR-007–FR-008).
- ✅ PyPI and Docker Hub mirroring enabled for immediate consumption (FR-009).
- ✅ End-to-end verification scripted in `tests/release/test_release.py` to assert artifact presence, documentation coverage, and installation sanity (FR-010).

## Upgrade Guidance

1. Pull the `v1.0.0` tag and install the wheel or Docker image.
2. Follow the upgrade section in `RELEASE_NOTES.md` to update configuration defaults.
3. Run `make release` locally to mirror the CI release flow for custom integrations.
4. Validate signatures with `cosign` and execute `pytest tests/release/test_release.py` for smoke coverage.

## Known Issues

- ARM64 Docker images remain experimental; use x86_64 images for production workloads.
- FFTW3 libraries must be pre-installed on Windows to unlock AVX2 optimizations.
