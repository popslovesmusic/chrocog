# Soundlab Modularization Validation

This report captures the final verification pass performed after modularizing `soundlab_v1.html`.

## Verification Scope
- Loaded the modularized interface via `soundlab_v1.html` to ensure partial injection succeeds with both network-served assets and offline fallbacks.
- Exercised transport, Î¦ generator, EQ, saturation, and image sonification controls to confirm every listener wired through `js/soundlab-events.js` remains functional.
- Observed the spectral and temporal visualizers for continuous updates driven by `requestAnimationFrame` loops from `js/soundlab-audio-core.js` once audio playback is active.
- Triggered log exports (CSV/JSON) and matrix refresh to validate stateful modules continue to share context.

## Findings
- Dynamic partial loading waits for completion before initializing logging and event subsystems, preserving original load order.
- Shared audio context, analyser chain, and parameter buffers are maintained in module scope and reused across events.
- Hidden file inputs for audio and image uploads are still accessible through control buttons and their keyboard shortcuts.
- No runtime or console errors surfaced during initialization, interaction, or teardown flows.

## Conclusion
The modularized Soundlab build retains feature parity with the monolithic `soundlab_v1.html`, satisfying the "preserve functionality" mandate for the final step of the SAFE modularization sequence.
